# Strategic-model-reduction-by-analysing-model-sloppiness-a-case-study-in-coral-calcification
The code and data visualisations associated with the paper "Strategic model reduction by analysing model sloppiness: a case study in coral calcification". The code and model output files contained in this repository are sufficient to generate all results shown in the paper (including all of the results shown in Supporting Information).

Please note that this code is somewhat generalised to demonstrate of the methods described in the paper. However, the code was written specifically for application to the coral calcification model proposed by Galli & Solidoro (2018). Please use caution when modifying this code for a different model or purpose. 

This code is run form the Main.m file.
